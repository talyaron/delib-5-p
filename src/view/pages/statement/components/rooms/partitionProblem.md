The problem you are asking about is a variant of the *partitioning problem¬π, which is a hard problem in computer science. It is also known as the **k-way partitioning problem¬≤ or the **equivalence partitioning problem*¬≥.

There are different algorithms that can solve this problem, but none of them are guaranteed to find the optimal solution in polynomial time. Some of them are based on heuristics, approximations, or greedy strategies.

One possible algorithm is based on the following steps‚Å¥:

- Sort the elements in descending order.
- Create X empty groups.
- For each element, assign it to the group with the lowest sum and the lowest size so far.
- Repeat until all elements are assigned.

This algorithm is simple and fast, but it may not always give the best solution.

Another possible algorithm is based on the following steps:

- Add all the elements and divide the sum by X. This is the target average value for each group.
- Find a subset of elements whose sum is closest to the target value and whose size is closest to the target size, using a modified knapsack algorithm.
- Remove the elements in the subset from the original sequence and repeat the process with X-1 groups.
- Repeat until all elements are assigned or no more subsets can be found.

This algorithm is more complex and slower, but it may give a better solution than the first one.

I hope this helps you understand some of the algorithms for this problem. If you want to see some examples of code that implement these algorithms, I can generate some for you. Just let me know which programming language you prefer. üôå
